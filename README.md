## 🃏 How to Play the Game

### The Basic Concept
Up and Down the River is a bidding card game. Players must predict exactly how many tricks they'll win each round. Make your bid exactly → bonus points. Miss your bid → only the tricks you took.

### The River
The game follows a "river" sequence of rounds:
- **Going Up:** 1 card, 2 cards, 3 cards … up to the maximum
- **Peak:** Maximum cards (based on player count)
- **Going Down:** … back down to 1 card

The maximum cards per round is: `min(10, floor(52 ÷ number_of_players))`

| Players | Max Cards | Total Rounds |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| 2       | 10        | 19           |
| 3       | 10        | 19           |
| 4       | 10        | 19           |
| 5       | 10        | 19           |
| 6       | 8         | 15           |
| 7       | 7         | 13           |
| 8       | 6         | 11           |

### Trump Suit Rotation
Trump suits cycle through: **Hearts → Clubs → Diamonds → Spades → Hearts …**

**Special middle 5 rounds** of the river alternate with No Trump:
`No Trump → [Next Suit] → No Trump → [Next Suit] → No Trump`

### Dealer Rule
The **dealer cannot bid** a number that would allow the total bids to equal the number of cards in play. This ensures at least one player will be "set" (miss their bid) every round.

### Scoring
| Result | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Made your bid exactly | **10 + number of tricks taken** |
| Missed your bid | **Only tricks taken** (no 10-point bonus) |

---

## 🔐 Roles & Permissions

The app has three roles selected in **Settings (⚙)**:

### 👁 Viewer (Default)
- Reads live data from the cloud automatically on load
- Can view all tournament standings and leaderboard stats
- **Cannot** start games, enter scores, or modify any data
- Perfect for players watching the tournament who just want to see standings

- Can push data to cloud after each game
- Can clear tournament or leaderboard data from the cloud
- Requires the admin password: `river2024`

> **To change the admin password:** Edit the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` constant at the top of the `<script>` section in `index.html`.

---

## 🏆 Tournament & Scoring Rules

### Tournament Structure
- A standard tournament is **20 games**
- Before starting a 21st game, the app prompts to finalize the current tournament
- Admins and Scorekeepers can finalize a tournament early at any time
- Each tournament gets a unique ID based on the start date (e.g., `T20240615`)

### Tournament Points System
Tournament Points (T-Points) are awarded after each game based on final game score ranking:

| Finish Position | T-Points (5-player game) |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| 1st Place      | 5 |
| 2nd Place      | 4 |
| 3rd Place      | 3 |
| 4th Place      | 2 |
| 5th Place      | 1 |

In an N-player game, 1st place always gets N points, last place always gets 1 point.

**Ties:** Tied players share the highest available rank's points. Example: two players tied for 2nd in a 5-player game both receive 4 points (not averaged).

---

## 💰 Financial Tracking (The Pot)

The app automatically calculates how much each player owes the pot after each game. All amounts are calculated when a game is finalized — no manual tracking needed.

### Money From Losses — $1.00
The player who finishes **last place** (lowest total game score) pays **$1.00** into the pot.
- Applied per game, not per round
- If multiple players tie for last, each pays $1.00

### Money From Penalties — $1.00 per increment
A performance penalty based on the **Tournament Threshold**:

**Threshold Formula:**
```
Threshold = (10 × (2 × maxCards − 1) − 20) − (10 × numberOfPlayers)
```

| Players | Max Cards | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 4       | 10        | 130       |
| 5       | 10        | 120       |
| 6       | 8         | 90        |
| 7       | 7         | 70        |

**How penalties work:**
- Score below threshold by 1–10 points → **$1.00**
- Score below threshold by 11–20 points → **$2.00**
- Score below threshold by 21–30 points → **$3.00**
- …and so on in $1 increments for every 10 points below

**Example (5-player game, threshold = 120):**
| Player | Score | Penalty |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Mom    | 145   | $0      |
| Georgia| 122   | $0      |
| Lucy   | 118   | $1 (2 pts below) |
| Jack   | 109   | $2 (11 pts below) |
| Dad    | 95    | $3 (25 pts below) |

Players can owe both a loss penalty AND a performance penalty in the same game.

## ☁️ Cloud Sync Setup (Google Sheets)

Cloud sync is optional. Scorekeepers can run the entire app locally. Admins get live sync to a shared Google Sheet.

### Step 1 — Create the Google Sheet
1. Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com) and create a new blank spreadsheet
2. Name it something like "River Tournament"
3. Note the spreadsheet ID from the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/`**`YOUR_ID_HERE`**`/edit`

### Step 2 — Create the Apps Script
1. In your Google Sheet, click **Extensions → Apps Script**
2. Delete all existing code in the editor
3. Open `gas_script.js` from this repository and **paste the entire contents**
4. Click **Save** (💾 icon or Ctrl+S)

### Step 3 — Deploy as Web App
1. Click **Deploy → New Deployment**
2. Click the gear icon ⚙ next to "Type" and select **Web app**
3. Fill in the settings:
   - **Description:** River Tournament API
   - **Execute as:** Me
   - **Who has access:** Anyone
4. Click **Deploy**
5. Click **Authorize access** and follow the Google sign-in prompts
6. Copy the **Web App URL** — it will look like:
   `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycb.../exec`

### Step 4 — Configure the App
1. Open the River app
2. Tap **Settings (⚙)**
3. Select **Admin** role and enter the password
4. Paste your Web App URL into the **Google Apps Script URL** field
5. Tap **Save Settings**

The app will now automatically sync data to your Google Sheet. The sheet will have four tabs:
- **Game Archive** — Every round of every game with all bids and scores
- **Tournament Stats** — Current tournament statistics table
- **Leaderboard Stats** — All-time statistics table
- **Meta** — Raw JSON data store (do not edit manually)

### Re-deploying After Changes
If you edit the Apps Script code, you must create a **new deployment** (not update existing) for changes to take effect:
1. **Deploy → New Deployment**
2. Copy the new URL and update it in the app's Settings

### Manual Stats Refresh
If you ever need to rebuild all stats from the Game Archive tab (e.g., after manually correcting data in the sheet):
1. Open Apps Script editor
2. Select the `manualStatsRefresh` function from the dropdown
3. Click **Run ▶**

This will re-parse the entire Game Archive, recalculate all stats, update all sheet tabs, and sync the data store.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Progressive Web App
- **Offline First:** Service worker caches all assets on first load; the app works with no internet connection after that
- **Installable:** Meets all PWA install criteria (manifest, service worker, HTTPS)
- **No dependencies:** Zero npm packages, no build step, no bundler — just open the HTML file
- **Single file:** The entire app except icons is self-contained in `index.html`

### Data Storage
| Layer | Technology | Used For |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Local | `localStorage` | Game in progress, tournament data, settings |
| Cloud | Google Apps Script | Shared data across all devices (Admin only) |

**Data structure:**
```javascript
// allTime — all games ever played
allTime = {
  games: [
    {
      id, tournamentId, gameNum, date,
      players: ['Mom', 'Georgia', ...],
      maxCards, threshold,
      rounds: [{ roundNum, cards, trump, scores: [{ name, bid, tricks, score, made }] }],
      totals:     { 'Mom': 145, 'Georgia': 122, ... },
      financials: { 'Mom': { losses: 0, penalties: 0, total: 0 }, ... },
      tPoints:    { 'Mom': 5, 'Georgia': 4, ... }
    },
    ...
  ]
}

// currentTournament — filtered view of allTime for current tournament
currentTournament = {
  id: 'T20240615',
  games: [ ...same structure as allTime.games... ]
}
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do all players need the app?**
A: No. Only the Scorekeeper needs to interact with the app. Other players can open it as Viewers to watch the standings update in real time, but it's not required.

**Q: What happens if the Scorekeeper's phone dies mid-game?**
A: The game is saved to the device's localStorage after every round committed. As long as you open the app again on the same device, you can resume exactly where you left off.

**Q: Can two people enter scores at the same time?**
A: No — only one Scorekeeper should enter data at a time. Viewers see read-only cloud data; they cannot edit. If two devices try to push simultaneously, the last write wins.

**Q: What if I made a mistake in a previous round?**
A: Tap the **✎ Edit** button during a game. Select the round you want to fix, update the bids and/or tricks, and save. All scores will recalculate automatically.

**Q: Can I change players between games in a tournament?**
A: Yes. Each game can have different players. The statistics engine handles players joining or leaving and tracks each player's stats independently. The standings table shows all players who have appeared in at least one game.

**Q: How do I start a brand new tournament?**
A: Go to **Settings → Finalize Tournament** (Scorekeeper/Admin) or tap the **Finalize** button on the home screen. This archives the current tournament and starts fresh.

**Q: The Google Sheets sync isn't working. What do I check?**
A: 
1. Make sure you deployed as a **Web App**, not just saved the script
2. Make sure **"Who has access"** is set to **"Anyone"** (not "Anyone with Google account")
3. Make sure you copied the **/exec** URL, not the **/dev** URL
4. Try creating a **new deployment** (changes require a new deployment to take effect)
5. Check that you're using the **Admin** role in the app settings

**Q: Can I use this for a different card game?**
A: The app is purpose-built for Up and Down the River's specific rules (river sequence, trump rotation, dealer rule, threshold scoring). Adapting it for other games would require modifying the core game logic functions.

**Q: How do I share the app with other players quickly?**
A: Open **Settings (⚙)** and show them the QR code at the bottom. They scan it and the app opens instantly in their browser. They can then add it to their home screen.
